My name is Vishal, I am a first year PhD student working with Prof. Rahimi in the [CIIR lab](https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/). My research interests are improving multimodal large and small language models at in-context learning. Previousy, I was a part of model optimization effort in Microsoft Turing team for training and inference of 530B parameter [Turing-NLG model](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/).
I was also responsible for the model compression effort of Image super resolution, Bing suggestion generation and semantic search on Microsoft Edge, where we compressed BERT/GPT2 models to tiny sizes (<10MB)!. Working on large scale systems at Microsoft led me to develop a fascination towards systems for deep learning and HPC.

Research
======
Previously I've worked on fact-verification where given a claim we had to first find relevant documents for the claim, then retrieve passages supporting or refuting the claim, our work got accepted in NAACL 2019 [Attentive-Checker](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1230/), I also studied the effects of language switching on hate-speech which was accepted in ACL 2020 [Code-Switching](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.96/) and debiasing multilingual word embeddings for Indian languages [Multilingual-Debias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10181) accepted in ACM Hypertext 2021.
